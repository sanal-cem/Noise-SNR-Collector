# Project Wifi Mobile Signal Level Analyzer - Noise meter for ANDROID

### Project Definition
Briefly, Noise meter for ANDROID Mobile Phones. In this project, the aim is to design and development of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measuring software for ANDROID based mobile phones. The volume of sounds using the ANDROID system helps to measure the noise (Noise Meter). An apparatus for comparing sound intensity levels usually in decibels. The signal quality could be easily understood. Mandatory features: Average, min, max and peak signal to noise ratios in dB will be shown with a nice interface. Users would draw routes from the map. Determining and showing the best and the worst path according to signal levels is done by the software. Every created route path is determined according to users SNR data.

### Versioning
Could be used between ANDROID 4.0 to 8.0 versions.
